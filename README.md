# Maven_Movies_SQL_Project
SQL Project based on Maven Movies database 

![Project_cover](SQL_Project.png)
In this project-based, highly engaging course by Maven Analytics, I took on the role of a business owner who recently acquired Maven Movies, a brick-and-mortar DVD rental shop. Using MySQL and MySQL Workbench, I analyzed the business's database to uncover key insights about inventory, staff performance and customer behavior. This hands-on experience allowed me to develop practical SQL skills to extract, join and interpret data, enabling data-driven decision-making for the business. 
At the end of the course, I applied these skills in the final project. The project involved addressing key questions from a potential acquirer of Maven Movies by analyzing various aspects of the business using SQL.
The project presentation in PDF format is available on my Google Drive.
